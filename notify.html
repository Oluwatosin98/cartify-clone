            <p>Dear Boluwatife,<br>

                I, Mrs Oyeniyi, your landlord, am writing you this letter to notify you regarding the rental agreement that took effect between us on (state the date). As per the agreement, the contract was supposed to expire on (state the month/date/year). It is (state the month), and as I was bound to notify you two months before the year-end of the rental contract. I am writing this letter of notification to remind you of the rental agreement. The rental agreement ends on (state the month/date/year), so you are requested to locate the house or the land before the end of (state the month). In case you want to renew the rental agreement, please inform me immediately when you receive the notification. Thank you! <br>
                
                Mrs Oyeniyi.</p>
